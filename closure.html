<!-- think of closure in this way
 The makeFunc does not execure the inner function that has the scope of the outer function and thus can access the name variable
 When the makeFunc() has been executed the scope is gone
 and the reference to displayname is attatched to myFunc
 so when the reference is give to variable, not just the function is given but the scope attatched to that function is sent as well because
 of lexical scoping
 The entire lexical scope is sent so name is still going to be console logged
